# End-to-End-Big-Data-Pipeline
I created an end to end big data pipeline to handle massive NYC Taxi datasets. It is a full ML pipeline to predict taxi fare amounts, trip durations and high demad areas. I have also built visual reports on trip demand patterns and prediction performance. This project mainly used Hadoop, Pyspark and Docker.
